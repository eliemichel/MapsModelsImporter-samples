MapsModelsImporter samples
==========================

This is a set of .rdc files that you can try to import to check your installation of [MapsModelsImporter](https://github.com/eliemichel/MapsModelsImporter).

Please make sure that You are using the recommended RenderDoc Version for the installed MapsModelsImporter Version:
- MapsModelsImporter <= 0.3.2:         RenderDoc Version 1.5 - 1.9
- MapsModelsImporter  = 0.3.3 - 0.3.5: RenderDoc Version 1.5 - 1.10
- RenderDoc Version 1.11 & 1.12 do not work yet (newest AddOn version 0.3.5)

Before opening a new Issue on GitHub please download a sample file to check if this works on your Computer.  
Please be patient. If there's no error message it most probably is still loading.  
Depending on the size of the sample file it may take a minute or two to load and Blender will get unresponsive during this time.  

If it works with a sample file you most probably shouldn't open a new issue on GitHub but figure out how to use RenderDoc.
Find instructions about using RenderDoc by searching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=RenderDoc)
